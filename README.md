# SquashTraining
Squash training is a project that aims at teaching a user how to play squash through a unity game.
This project is done using kinect.
The user stands in front of the kinect holding the squash racquet while a sqush court is displayed in front of the user using a projector
or a big screen displaying the court from unity.
Random balls are generated from the squash court with random angles and random speeds and at different target positions,and the user should
move towards the random balls and hit them using the racquet.
Then the kinect senses the position of the user's hand and joints as well as the angle of the direction of his legs whenever he moves 
towards the ball,then it checks whether the user is maintaining the correct positions or not.
if not an error message should appear to the user on the screen telling him what he did wrong.
